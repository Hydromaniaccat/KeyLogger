 Compile with cx_freeze into an exe for windows users without python and modules.
 Then combine into one file using w/e you want.
 I combine it with winrar and add a .bat that copies and autoruns.

 ```
sc create BSGService start= auto binpath= "C:\Program Files (x86)\BSG Service\dist\Service Host.exe"
"dist\Service Host.exe"
 ```
