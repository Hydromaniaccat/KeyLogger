 Compile with cx_freeze into an exe for windows users without python and modules.
 Then combine into one file using w/e you want.
 I combine it with winrar and add a .bat that copies and autoruns.

Still could use some modifications (I'll finish this later):
-multiple threading for sender function
-more efficient sendcheck function, so it doesn't have to check EVERY run
